This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The whole point of standing this repo up was to migrate it to the [next app directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)

This app consists of two pages, the index page at `/` and a page that fetches 10 random cat facts, which is at `/data`.
There's also an api route that came with the boilerplate code from create-next-app, but that did not get ported over.

To see this app converted to a next app that uses the app router, [go to this repo](https://github.com/CalebPenning/next-app-migration)
